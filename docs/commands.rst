Commands
========

This should provide information on each command available to Bonfire.

.. note::
   By default the prefix used is either `?` or `!`, both work. However, this can
   be changed using the command `prefix`. Due to this, only the command name will
   be what is labeled when described. For example, if your prefix has been set to >
   and the command is `example` then it will be labeled as `example` in the documentation,
   however you would call the command using `>example`.

.. data:: help

   This command is used in order to bring up information about commands.
   It can be used in a few ways, by itsself to bring up an interactive list of all the
   commands. You can run also run it on another command, for example `help help` to 
   provide more information no that command. You can also run `help 5` to bring up the 
   5th page of the interactive menu.
